# odin-recipes
Odin foundation exercise.

For exercise, I have created a home webpage that links to other webpages showing other recipes.

This project has allowed me to demonstrate the following skills:
- Using boilerplates.
- Using anchors to link to other webpages with some element of security and privacy.
- Displaying images with an element of accessibility and consistency.
- Creating ordered and unordered lists.
- Nesting elements.
- Structuring a webpage to some extent.
